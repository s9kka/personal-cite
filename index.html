      <h3>Video Editing </h3>
      <p>I started video editing last year and ever since then i fell in love with it. I opened an editing instagram account and just edited whatever felt right but after sometime looking at other people's edits i wanted better. I knew i could do better which is what made me switch platforms. I tried out sony vegas but to me it seemed wayy too complicated even though people says it's a lot easier than after effects. To me after effects came to me naturally, it wasn't hard like people said and i caught on quick. Now it's just the matter of fact as improving with my skills which brings me to now </p>
